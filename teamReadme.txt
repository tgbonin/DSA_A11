	For the assignment, we didn't exactly separate out the work as it would have been difficult to try and split this type of assignment up. To complete this assignment, we had a group meeting in which we all crowded around a computer and figured out step by step what needed to be done. From brainstorming to typing out the code, everyone contributed equaly.
